Module 6: 

Display one panel at a time using ngIf. Components used: Output() and EventEmitter()

Delete items from an array.

Emit events. Events are propagated to the parent. Have not learned to use ngRoute as of yet. Emitted events in a crude fashion, using a chain of EventEmitter()â€™s that passed information from child to parent. 

Using local references. #localReference

Placement of information (where the array goes that contains the information)

ViewChild() - viewing the elements of the current component. 

ViewChild() + EventEmitter() - Emit the local elements into parent component component. 

Event listeners. 

*ngFor - Iterate over elements in an array

(click) - formerly ngClick in AngularJS
